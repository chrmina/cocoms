# CoCoMS: Construction Correspondence Management System

**DEMO**: [CoCoMS Demo](http://christos.heliohost.org/cocoms/)

Login Credentials (login:pass)
* User -> user:user
* Editor -> editor:editor
* Admin -> admin:admin

## Introduction
CoCoMS is a simple Document Management System designed specifically for the management of correspondence generated during the execution of a construction project. CoCoMS is targeted at document controllers and key staff of a construction project. The system can be used by the staff of the Contractor, the Engineer and / or the Employer.

### Why CoCoMS was developed?
Scratching an itch! I wanted to create a simple yet powerful document management web-based system specifically for the management of correspondence generated during the execution of a construction project. I needed a system that can be used by the whole construction team and has the ability to control the access to the data based on the role of each user. Also wanted the system to be easily accessible using just a WEB browser and have the ability to export data in Microsoft Excel format for further analysis and presentation.

## System Design

### System Structure
The system consists of five modules:
* Letters
* Senders
* Recipients
* Work Packages
* User Administration.

The modules become available to a user after a successful login via a dropdown menu on the top of the system's UI. Depending on the user's role, different actions become available, (e.g. only administrators can add, delete and edit users). Please refer to the System Modules section for details regarding each module.

### About WBS
In designing CoCoMS I have assumed that the construction project is organized in work packages (WP) following the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) method.

A WP is the smallest unit of a Work Breakdown Structure and consist of a group of related tasks within a project. The idea is to break down the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable chunks of work in order to be better scheduled, cost estimated, monitored and controlled. WP are typically grouped into work packages based on geographical area, engineering discipline, technology, or the time needed to accomplish them. You can visualize WP as mini-projects within the whole project.

The WBS is a method for getting a complex, multi-step project done. Itâ€™s a way to divide and conquer large projects so you can get things done faster and more efficiently. WBS is a hierarchical tree structure that outlines your project and breaks it down into smaller, more manageable portions. Breaking the project down into work packages means work can be done simultaneously by different team members, leading to better team productivity and easier project management overall.

### Access Control
In order to properly manage the data in CoCoMS and avoid accidental deletions and system abuses users are given different access control via a role scheme. There are 4 types of users in CoCoMS: unregistered users (guests), users (i.e. registered users), editors and administrators.

#### Unregistered Users (Guests)
Any user that is not registered in CoCoMS is considered to be an Unregistered User i.e. Guest User. Unregistred users cannot view, add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS. They can only see the general information pages listed in the footer, such as this one.

#### Users (Registered Users)
Registered users can be added only by an administrator. Once active, a registered user can only view all CoCoMS data except the data of other users' profiles. A registered user cannot add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS, except modifying its own profile data via the Profile menu.

#### Editors
Editors can be added only by an administrator. Once active, an editor can view, add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS except other users' profiles. An editor can only edit its own profile data via the Profile Menu.

#### Administrators
Administrators have full access to all data in CoCoMS. They can view, add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS and can add, edit or delete new users. 

## System Modules

### Letters
This module deals with the management of the correspondence (letters). CoCoMS assumes that letters are issued in relation to WP. As such, the letters are named and organized accordingly. Please refer to the section discussing letter naming below for details regarding the letter naming convention.

#### Actions

##### List Letters
Here you can see data about all the letters stored in the database. You can also filter the letter data by sender, recipient and work package. Alternatively you can search for specific keywords. Note that only users having Editor or Administrator privileges can edit or delete letters from the database.

The following action buttons will be available (depending on the user role) next to each listed letter:
* The eye button will enable you to see detailed information about a specific letter.
* The pencil button will enable you to edit a specific letter.
* The trash button will enable you to delete a specific letter.

##### Add Letter
Fill the form to add a letter in the database. Note that only users having Editor or Administrator privileges can add letters in the database.

Form Fields:
* **Subject**: Enter the subject / title of the letter.
* **Data File**: Click on the button to add and save the file (e.g. PDF) associated with the letter in the database. Refer to Letter Naming for details regarding the file naming convention.
* **Sender**: Select the sender of the letter from the drop-down menu.
* **Recipient**: Select the recipient of the letter from the drop-down menu.
* **Work Package**: Select the work package associated with the letter from the drop-down menu.
* **Letter Ref. No. (Docref)**: Enter the letter's reference number.
* **Letter Date**: When you click on the input box a calendar dialog will appear that will enable you to select the letter's date. Alternatively you can input the date manually using the format YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2017-10-31.
* **Contents**: Enter the contents (main body) of the letter. This will allow you in the future to search the database for specific keywords contained in the letter body.
* **References**: Enter the letter's references. These are treated like tags. If a reference number is already in the database it will automatically appear in the list.
* **Confidential**: If the letter is confidential then click on the checkbox.
* **Reply Requested**: If a reply is required for the letter then click on the checkbox.
* **Add New Letter Button**: Click on the button to save the letter data in the database. 

##### Create Excel File
Clicking on this menu item will generate a Microsoft Excel file that contains all the letters' related data saved in the database. 

#### Letter Naming
In order to keep things tidy and in order it is suggested that a letter naming convention is followed. It is assumed that the project is broken down in work packages (WP) and each WP is assigned a unique number.

##### Naming Convention
The naming convention for letters is **SENDER-RECIPIENT-WPNumber-TYPE-XXXXX** where:
* **SENDER**: The sender's name. For example if the sender is ACME Corporation then SENDER will be ACME.
* **RECIPIENT**: The recipient's name. For example if the recipient is Smith Corporation then RECIPIENT will be SMITH.
* **WPNumber**: The unique number of the work package. For example if the work package is 20000-Civil Works then WPNumber will be 20000. Note that letters not related to any WP shall be given the unique number 00000.
* **TYPE**: The correspondence type: Use L for Letters, RFI for Requests for Information, RFA for Requests for Approval, etc.
* **XXXXX**: A unique number identifying the letter, e.g. 000164.

##### Letter Name Examples
Assume that a letter was sent from ACME Corporation to Smith Corporation regarding WP 20000-Civil Works. The letter should be named: **ACME-SMITH-20000-L-00096**.

Assume that a letter was sent from Brown Corporation to Homer Corporation not related to any specific WP. The letter should be named: **BROWN-HOMER-00000-L-00243**.

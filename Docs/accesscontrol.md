## Overview
In order to properly manage the data in CoCoMS and avoid accidental deletions and system abuses users are given different access control via a role scheme. There are 4 types of users in CoCoMS: unregistered users (guests), users (i.e. registered users), editors and administrators.

### Unregistered Users (Guests)
Any user that is not registered in CoCoMS is considered to be an Unregistered User i.e. Guest User. Unregistred users cannot view, add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS. They can only see the general information pages listed in the footer, such as this one.

### Users (Registered Users)
Registered users can be added only by an administrator. Once active, a registered user can only view all CoCoMS data except the data of other users' profiles. A registered user cannot add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS, except modifying its own profile data via the Profile menu.

### Editors
Editors can be added only by an administrator. Once active, an editor can view, add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS except other users' profiles. An editor can only edit its own profile data via the Profile Menu.

### Administrators
Administrators have full access to all data in CoCoMS. They can view, add edit or delete any data in CoCoMS and can add, edit or delete new users.

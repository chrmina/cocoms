## Introduction
CoCoMS is a simple Document Management System designed specifically for the management of correspondence generated during the execution of a construction project. CoCoMS is targeted at document controllers and key staff of a construction project. The system can be used by the staff of the Contractor, the Engineer and / or the Employer.

## Why CoCoMS was developed?
Scratching an itch! I wanted to create a simple yet powerful web-based document management system specifically for the management of correspondence generated during the execution of a construction project. I needed a system that can be used by the construction team and has the ability to control the access to the data based on the role of each user. Also wanted the system to be easily and readily accessible (i.e. using just a WEB browser) and have the ability to export data in Microsoft Excel format for further analysis and presentation.

# Features
CoCoMS is easily accessible via a modern web browser. Access is secured via user authentication and [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list).

The system is consists of five integrated modules:
* Letters
* Senders
* Recipients
* Work Packages
* User Administration.

The modules become available to a user after a successful login via a dropdown menu on the top of the system's UI. Depending on the user's role, different actions become available, (e.g. only administrators can add, delete and edit users). For information about each module and how there can be used please read the respective documents.

# Contribution Guidelines

Please feel free to contribute to the CoCoMS with new issues, requests, unit tests, code fixes, or even new features. If you'd like to contribute some code of your own, simply fork the CoCoMS repository and create a new branch from develop if a new feature or significant modification, or from master if a bug fix, then send us a pull request with your changes. Compliance with the [conventions](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/intro/conventions.html) and [coding standards](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/contributing/cakephp-coding-conventions.html), as well as the inclusion of [unit tests](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/development/testing.html) for new features or detected issues, are mandatory to keep CoCoMS code quality high. It's important to note that your contribution may not be accepted if it does not follow these guidelines.
